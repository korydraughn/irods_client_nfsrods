Should "chmod" be supported?
============================

chmod 0X00 ...
  where "X" is the only properties a user can adjust.
  
The table below is what I'm thinking chmod will assign as
the permissions in iRODS for each Linux permission config.

Collections will automatically have the execute bit set.
Data objects will never have the execute bit set.

Q. What should 0001 map to?
Q. Does setting the execute bit make sense in NFSRODS and iRODS?
Q. Should the execute bit be ignored?
Q. Does anything look like it could lead to issues?

rwx v iRODS
--- - --------------
000 0 null
001 1 ?
010 2 write
011 3 write
100 4 read
101 5 read
110 6 own or write?
111 7 own or write?

When stat is called on a collection or data object, the iRODS
permissions are mapped like so:

iRODS rwx
----- ---
own   110
write 110
read  100
